Time:
O(n)

Space:
O(1)

---

The given solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1),
where n is the number of elements in the array nums.

Here's the breakdown:

Time Complexity:
The solution iterates through each element of the array nums once using a single loop.
Since the loop runs for n iterations,
where n is the length of the array nums, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
The solution modifies the input array nums in-place without using any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input.
It only uses a constant amount of extra space for a few variables (k, i), regardless of the size of the input array.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
