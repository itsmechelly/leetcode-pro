let n be the length of order,
and m be the total number of characters in words.

Storing the letter-order relation of each letter takes O(n) time.
For the nested for-loops, we examine each pair of words in the outer-loop
and for the inner loop, we check each letter in the current word.
Therefore, we will iterate over all of letters in words.

Taking both into consideration,
the time complexity is O(m + n).

However, we know that NN is fixed as 26.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(m).

time O(m)

The only extra data structure we use is the array
that serves to store the letter-order relations for each word in order.
Because the length of order is fixed as 26,
this approach achieves constant space complexity.

space O(1)
