Array:

l1 = s1.length
l2 = s2.length

time O( l1*log(l1) + (l2-l1) * l1*log(l1))
time O(nlog(n))

"sortedArray" was used
space O(l1)

HashMap:

l1 = s1.length
l2 = s2.length

the HashMap contains almost 26 keys
time O(l1 + 26*l1(l2-l1))
time O(n*m)

the HashMap contains at most 26 key-value pairs
space O(1)
